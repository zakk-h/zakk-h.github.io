We present a mixed-methods investigation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) care at Duke University, aimed at identifying opportunities for responsible and clinically aligned AI decision support. The project combines rapid qualitative analysis of clinician interviews and shadowing across the TBI care pathway with large-scale curation and quality assurance of multimodal electronic health record data. Findings highlight key documentation challenges, sources of clinical variability, and stakeholder-guided requirements for AI deployment, alongside the construction of a curated TBI dataset to support future modeling and benchmarking.
